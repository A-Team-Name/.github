# A Team Name's 4th Year Project
This Organisation/Project aims to create a web app tool allowing academics/students to handwrite code from extended character set languages such as [APL](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page), [Lambda Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus), and more.

The project may also pivot towards an educational setting, allowing younger children who may not be computer literate the opportunity to learn programming logic in an easy to use language, such as Python.

## Branch Rules
This is a private (free) org, so branch rules are not allowed :(. However, we do have some practices we would like to adhere to:
### Enscribe
This is our main repository, where we will have a strict(er) set of rules for branching
- `main` Branch: This is the current deployed version of the web app
- `dev` Branch: This is the branch with the next release "completed" - For QA purposes
- Feature Branches: These represent a specific issue on our Projects Board
- Other Branches: Use these to make small changes for new features. These can be used as wished!
PR and Merges should follow a hierarchical pattern. Your branch should merge to its parent branch. i.e. only `dev` can merge into `main`, only feature branches can merge into `dev` etc.

### Perceptor
This repository is less strict. To start off with can we create `ipynb` notebooks showing how each model we are testing works. Ideally resulting in showing key metrics.
These can be merged directly to main!

When this project expands and we start to make a Python package, then the processes will work similarly to Enscribe.
